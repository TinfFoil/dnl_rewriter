# DNL Rewriter

This repository contains data and code related to our paper submitted to the 6th Workshop on Gender Bias in NLP which is scheduled to have place at ACL 2025. 

## Data
* The `data` folder contains the manual DNL reformulations that we add to the source datasets we used to create our task-specific training dataset. 
* The `dataset` folder contains our training dataset, split into train and test sets. 
* The `adapted_neogate` folder contains the version of Neo-GATE we adapted to our DNL grammar (as defined in `schwa_template.json`); `neomorphemes.txt` is needed to run the evaluation. 
Please refer to [the original dataset folder](https://huggingface.co/datasets/FBK-MT/Neo-GATE) for details on the adaptation and evaluation process. 

## Code
The `scripts` we share are used for the following purposes:
* `create_my_dataset.py` creates a copy of our training dataset, using files from the `data` folder
* `finetune_rewriter.py` fine-tunes a model on our task using our training dataset
* `generate_predictions.py` collects raw outputs on the evaluation dataset from a fine-tuned model
* `prompt_rewriter.py` prompts a model to perform our task and collects its raw outputs on the evaluation dataset; prompts are created following our prompt templates and using our training dataset when in a few-shot setting

## Results
The `experiments` folder contains the following for each of the experiments we carried out:
* post-processed (cleaned) model predictions that can be evaluated directly
* detailed reports generated by Neo-GATE about the evaluation
* a LaTeX table containing the metrics as computed on each predictions file
